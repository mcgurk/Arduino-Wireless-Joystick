# Arduino-Wireless-Joystick

Atari -> Atari wireless connection with two Arduino and 433MHz transmitter-receiver kit.

Old computers like Commodore 64 are usually 5V, so 5V Arduino may be better choice than 3.3V Arduino for receiver.

Arduino Nano 5V are good choice because it is cheap and it has built-in USB-port for programming.
